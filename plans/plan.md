## Risk Management

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Scope creep:** Solution - Regularly reference PROJECT_CONTEXT.md scope boundaries
2. **Insufficient sources:** Solution - Expand search to adjacent fields (philosophy, computer science, international law)
3. **Weak arguments:** Solution - Test against steel-man counterarguments early
4. **Timeline slippage:** Solution - Weekly progress reviews and adjustment
5. **Rejection:** Solution - Have backup venues identified; be prepared to revise
