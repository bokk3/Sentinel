# Research Notes: IHL & Defensive AI (Deep Dive)

**Phase:** 1.1 Literature Review (Advanced)

## 1. Definition of "Attack" (Article 49, AP I)

- **Text:** "Acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defence."
- **The Intercept Nuance:**
  - _Neutralization:_ Intercepting a missile mid-air and destroying it (Iron Dome style) is generally _not_ considered a new "attack" against the adversary, but a neutralization of their attack.
  - _Redirection:_ If a system redirects the missile back at the sender, that _is_ an "attack" and triggers all IHL obligations (Distinction, Proportionality).
- **Sentinel Implication:** The system must be strictly characterized as a _neutralization_ system to minimize legal jeopardy.

## 2. Updated Sources

- ICRC Commentary on Additional Protocol I, Article 49.
