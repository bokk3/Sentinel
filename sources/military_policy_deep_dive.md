## 1. DoD Directive 3000.09 "Positive ID" Reality

- **Finding:** 3000.09 does _not_ explicitly mandate "Positive Identification" (PID) in those exact words as a standalone step for autonomous systems.
- **Instead:** It emphasizes "Appropriate Human Judgment" and rigorous **Testing and Evaluation (T&E)**.
- **The "Traceability" Standard:** The system must be auditable. We need to know _why_ it thought the target was valid.
- **Training Requirement:** Operators must be trained on the _limitations_ of the system.
- **Implication:** Our "Sentinel" ruleset can be the _mechanism_ for ensuring this auditability.
