# Research Notes: Just War Theory & Defensive AI (Deep Dive)

## 1. Jus ad Vim (Force Short of War)

- **Concept:** Walzer and others (e.g., Brunstetter) argue for a category of _Jus ad Vim_—the just use of limited force (drones, cyber, limited strikes) that doesn't rise to full war.
- **AI Relevance:** AI defense often operates in this "Grey Zone."
  - _Pro:_ Jus ad Vim allows for proportional responses (e.g., shooting down a drone) without declaring full war.
  - _Con:_ It risks "Escalation Ease." If AI makes using force "easy" and low-risk, leaders might use it more often, leading to "death by a thousand cuts" or unintended escalation.
